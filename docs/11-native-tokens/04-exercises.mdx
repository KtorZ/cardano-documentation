### Prerequisites

1. You should be familiar with setting up and operating a Cardano node.
2. Read the explainer about multi-asset tokens, documentation on how to work
   with the Cardano node, and operations with multi-asset tokens in the sections
   above.
3. Checkout and build the `github` sources for the `cardano-node` that have been
   tagged with `mary`.
4. Start a Cardano node that you can submit commands to.

### Objectives

This set of exercises is aimed to ensure that you can:

1. Manage existing native tokens;
2. Create new native tokens;
3. Submit transactions that include native tokens on the Cardano blockchain.

Please report any bugs or improvements through the `cardano-node` github
repository.

### Exercises

1. Create a set of private/public signing keys, _shelley_, and three _addresses_
   _(ada, mary and percy)_. Fund _ada_ from the _faucet_. Request some
   **Wollstonecraft** tokens from the token owner to fund your _mary_ address.
   Verify that both addresses have the expected values. What do you observe
   about the _mary_ values?
2. Send 100 **ada** from _ada_ to _mary_, and 10 **Wollstonecraft** from _mary_
   to _percy_. Check the values of all three addresses before and after the
   transactions.
3. Define a _minting policy script_ for the **KingOfKings** currency that allows
   _shelley_ to create new **Ozymandian** tokens.
4. Mint 1000 new **Ozymandians** in the _percy_ address. Check that they have
   been successfully minted. Note that you might need to fund the _percy_
   address with additional **ada**.
5. What is the least amount of **ada** that you need to keep in each of your
   addresses? What is the least amount of **Ozymandians** or **Wollstonecraft**
   that you can keep in an address?
6. You want to _redeem_ some of your **Wollstonecraft** tokens. How do you do
   this? Similarly, how do you redeem your **Ozymandians**? What happens to your
   **ada** balances when you redeem your tokens?
7. Create a new _minting policy script_ that allows _shelley_ to create
   **Wollstonecraft**, **ada** and **Ozymandian** tokens. Mint new tokens of
   each type and send them to _mary_ and _percy_. Check that they have been
   successfully received. What do you observe about the balances on each of the
   addresses?
8. Create five new signing addresses: _athena_, _zeus_, _hera_, _poseidon_ and
   _dionysus_. Create a _minting policy script_ that allows any majority of the
   five Olympians to mint **Platinum**, **Gold**, **Silver** and **Bronze**
   medals. Send _percy_ one new **Gold** medal, and send _mary_ one new
   **Platinum** medal, two **Gold** medals, and four **Silver** medals. Check
   the balances for each of your addresses. Now transfer one **Gold** medal and
   one **Silver** medal from _mary_ to _percy_ and check the balances again.

**Optional exercises**

9. Set up a number of “mints” that each produce coins of a specific type. The
   values of each of the coins is given below.

| Coin     | Value                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Pound    | 20 shillings             |
| Merk     | 13 shillings and 4 pence |
| Noble    | 6 shillings and 8 pence  |
| Shilling | 12 pence                 |
| Bawbee   | 6 pence                  |
| Groat    | 4 pence                  |
| Penny    | 1 pence                  |

Each mint may produce new coins to match the value of any coins that are sent to
a specific address. For example, if the **Bawbee** address is sent three
**Groats**, two new **Bawbees** may be minted. Coins can be minted up to the
value that has been received. Any excess is lost. So if the **Noble** mint
address is sent 8 **Shilling** coins, then one new **Noble** coin is minted in
exchange.

> Please note that until we have Plutus scripts, there is no way to enforce
> these conversion rates on-chain, and you will need to do them manually.

10. Set up a “coin exchange” with one or more colleagues. Each of you is
    responsible for one or more “mints”. You should each set up an exchange
    address and fund it with newly minted coins that are worth precisely
    twenty-one shillings. Now practice sending coins and changing them for ones
    of equivalent value. For example, if someone sends you two **Merk** coins,
    you might return one **Pound** coin and one **Noble** coin, or any other
    equivalent value that you like. Use transaction metadata to record the coin
    exchanges on-chain. If you cannot give the exact change, give the closest
    value that you can.

11. Adapt your exchanges so that you charge a fee of 10% for each transaction.
    Record this in a separate account. Exchange coins until one of you can no
    longer make change.

Thank you for completing the exercises!
